		description: "Vatium, a company specializing in crafting effective presentations under tight deadlines, developed Slide5, a platform designed to streamline the presentation quoting process. The platform allows users to input details such as delivery timelines, slide count, target audience, and file uploads. I implemented a promotional code system and integrated payment gateways to automate the entire quoting and payment process. The result was a highly intuitive interface that significantly improved efficiency and helped Vatium deliver faster, more effective services to its clients.",

		description: "Tiros y Tijeras is an educational app designed by students and professors from the Communication Laboratory at the University of Caldas. It helps users, especially in educational communities, learn to argue using everyday examples grounded in logic and philosophy. Without requiring user registration, the app introduces four main characters that guide users through playing games, learning about fallacies, watching stories, or exploring the app's creators. I was responsible for bringing this concept to life by developing a fully functional mobile application that met all the creators' and designers' specifications. Despite no longer being available on app stores, the project was a success, and I take pride in its completion.",
